Quantum ducks are watching you
Now with 37% more entropy
Batteries not included
Warning: May simulate reality too hard
Certified slightly cursed™
Running on hopes and cosmic background radiation
Objects in code are closer than they appear
100% bug-free! (statistically improbable)
Now featuring extra gravity
Proudly powered by spaghetti code
Don’t feed the algorithms after midnight
Physics? Optional
Oops, all particles!
Shh… the universe is loading
Who gave the electrons coffee?!
Please wait while reality compiles…
We broke causality again
Bugs or features? Yes
Life: simulated accidentally since Step 3
Press any quark to continue
Reality patch notes pending

Powered by questionable math
Achievement Unlocked: Existence
Your universe has crashed unexpectedly
Divide by zero to win
E=mc² but cooler
May contain traces of antimatter
Experimental reality build
Powered by bad decisions and good vibes
Gravity not guaranteed
Reloading the multiverse…
Now with extra dimensions
Laws of physics sold separately
Simulation running in hardcore mode
Some assembly of atoms required
Chaos engine initialized
Don’t look at the code
Oops… forgot friction again
Coffee > Energy Conservation
Made with stardust and duct tape
Infinite monkeys are typing…
Debug mode: reality
Entropy always wins
Is this a bug or a feature?
Fabric of reality needs ironing
Currently violating thermodynamics
Lag detected in spacetime
Out of bounds: please respawn
Your simulation is our sandbox
Unstable quantum version
Patched: Schrödinger’s cat exploit
